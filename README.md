# Data analysis - Campus recruitment
Performing EDA and creating logistic regression to predict chances of securing job placement during a campus recruitment

## What do we see?
In this dataset, we explored the criteria to secure a job placement. Does student who excel academically have a higher chance to secure a job placement? Not really. My analysis have shown that specialisation place a much more significant role instead. It seems like students with specialisation related to finance have a higher chance of getting a job placement.
